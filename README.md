# `array_keys()`++

For this PHP code exercise, create a file named `array_search_keys.php`. This file should contain a function named `array_search_keys()` which accepts two parameters. The first parameter *must* be an array. The second parameter is an *optional* string.

`array_search_keys()` is very similar to the [`array_keys()`](http://php.net/array_keys) in PHP. However, instead of the second parameter matching against the input values, `array_search_keys()` should match against the input keys.

**Note:** for this exercise, you can assume that all keys within the given array are strings.
